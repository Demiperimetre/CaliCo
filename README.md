# CaliCo
The purpose of `CaliCo` is to perform code calibration in a Bayesian Framework.
This package was originally developed by Mathieu Carmassi and 
was available on CRAN. This version contains some corrections
but is not ready to go back on CRAN.


You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Demiperimetre/CaliCo")
```
